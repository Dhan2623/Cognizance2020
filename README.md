### Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.

![Python logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)

 Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. 
 
 It was created and released by Guido Van Rossum.

> Operations that you can perform using my scientic calculator

| Operations that can be done |Operators used   |
| ---------------- | ---------|
| Addition         |    +     |
| Subtraction      |    -     |
| Multiplication   |    *     |
| Division         |     /    |
| Power            |    **    |

| Operations that can be done       | In- built Functions used |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
|Square Root       |math.sqrt() |
|Absolute          |math.fabs() |
|Sine Function     |math.sin()  |
|Cosine Function   |math.cosin()|
|Tangent Function  |math.tan()  | 
|Ceil              |math.ceil() |
|Floor             |math.floor()|
---

>**NOTE --** *All these in-built functions are available in the python library "math"*.
---


## Explanation of the Source code:
---
1. To use these mathematical functions we have to type the following code....

``` Python
import math
```
2. Then, we have to create functions to perform each and every operation. These functions are called as **user-defined** functions.

*For example....*
``` Python
def add(a,b):
    return a+b
```
``` Python
def sin(x):
    # Here math.sin(x) is an in-built function
    result=math.sin(x)
    return result
```
3. After creating the user-defined fuctions for all the operations, Let's create a list stating specific numbers to specific operations so that we can choose any specific operation to perform using a number. Here, print() function should be used so that the user of the calculator can see the list during execution.

**(1-Add, 2-Subtract, 3-Product, 4-Division, 5-SquareRoot, 6-Power, 7-Remainder, 8-Square, 9-Absolute, 10-sin(x), 11-cos(x), 12-tan(x), 13-ceil, 14-floor)**

4. Now, let's get the choice from the user which he/she wanted to do.

5. Now, let's create a while loop with a condition, choice <== 14: i.e., If the choice chosen by the user is less than or equal to 14, then the loop gets executed. Orelse the control comes out.
``` Python
while choice <= 14:
```

6. By using if...elif...else statements, we should create a set of code for getting the inputs required for the operation, and call the function that we should use for that operation.
*Syntax*
``` Python
if <condition_1>:
     <Statements to get the parameters to perform the respective operation>
elif <condition_2>:
     <Statements to get the parameters to perform the respective operation>
.
.
.
else:
     <Statements to get the parameters to perform the respective operation>
```

7. To continue performing operations, we can get input whether to continue or not from the user. If yes-1 and if no-0.

8. Then we have to create another if loop to continue erforming the operation. If the use press 1 then the whole while loop repeats whereas when the user press 0 or any other number, the loop will break.

## Raw output :

> Let's take this as an example of the ouput in the scientific calculator

> Press F5 to execute the command and display the output

Choose a number for the following operations.....

 1 - Addition(a,b)

 2 - Subtraction(a,b)

 3 - Multiplication(a,b)

 4 - Division(a,b)

 5 - Square_Root(a)

 6 - Power(a,b) -- Power of 'a' times 'b'
 
 7 - Remainder(a,b)
 
 8 - Square(a)
 
 9 - Absolute(a)

10 - sin(x)

11 - cos(x)

12 - tan(x)

13 - ceil(x)

14 - floor(x)

Enter the number to choose the operation you wanter to perform: **4**

Enter two numbers....

Enter a: **5**

Enter b: **3**

The division of 5 by 3 is: 2

Do you like to continue to perform other operation? (YES-1)/(NO-0) **1**

What operation do you like to do next? Please select the number:**13**

Enter a: **4.74**

The ceil of 4.74 is: 5

Do you like to continue to perform other operation? (YES-1)/(NO-0) **0**

Thanks for using our scientific calculator!!
